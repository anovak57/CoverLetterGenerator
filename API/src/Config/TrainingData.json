  "GeneralInstructions": "Keep your cover letter brief and to the point. Avoid filler words and overly complex sentences. A clear, straightforward approach helps convey your message so key details stand out. Do not include introductory phrases such as 'Certainly! Here is a sample cover letter template for a job listing.' Avoid adding address blocks for both the applicant and the recipient; focus only on the content of the cover letter itself.",
  "Structure": "I. Introduction - Briefly introduce yourself. Mention the specific job position you're applying for. \n II. Why you're a fit - Highlight one to two key qualifications or experiences that align with the job requirement (try incorporating relevant keywords from the job description). \n III. Passion and enthusiasm - Express genuine interest in the role and the company. (This is a great place to weave in a specific company value or mission.) \n IV. Value proposition - Quickly mention what you can bring to the organization regarding skills, achievements, or potential contributions using keywords from the job description. \n V. Closing statement - Politely thank the reader for their time."
